# TAA Discovery System

## Overview
The TAA Discovery System is an innovative framework designed for the identification and prioritization of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) for TCE or ADC. By integrating diverse datasets—including multi-omics repositories and scientific publications—this system systematically enhances TAA discovery. Utilizing a graph retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced language model, it extracts insights from biological/clinical (internal or public) literature and seamlessly incorporates curated oncology-related omics databases such as TCGA, GTEx, single-cell atlases, and additional omics datasets.

## Features
- **Graph RAG-enhanced Language Model**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to efficiently extract relevant information from vast amounts of scientific literature.
- **Omics Database Integration**: Facilitates the integration of data from TCGA, GTEx, and other relevant databases for comprehensive analyses.
- **Safety Score**: Prioritizes TAAs with high tumor selectivity and low on-target/off-tumor risk, ensuring targeted therapy with minimal side effects.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Offers a data-agnostic strategy to address attrition challenges in TAA target identification and prioritization.
